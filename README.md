# Industrial Product Defect Detection Using Custom U-Net
Numerous automated labor-saving systems have
been created and implemented to lower production costs and
enhance product quality. Systems for intelligent visual analysis
are now playing a more significant role in production lines. Many
deep learning and machine learning techniques were previously
used to identify defective products. Still, the models were never
tested because they did not produce satisfactory results and had
numerous other problems adjusting to sparse and poor-quality
data. To address this issue, a deep learning-based customized UNet
model was introduced in this proposed work. This model
was trained on six different classes of data sets to assess the
modelâ€™s capability on different image textures and resolutions.
The proposed model had an overall accuracy of 97.25%. We also
achieved significantly higher precision, recall, and F1 scores of
96.04%, 95.58%, and 96.12%, respectively. The execution times
of six different classes can indicate how well a model performs,
and the average execution time is only 33.1 seconds, according
to observations.
